# BLACKBOX_API_KEY Configuration Issue - Resolution Summary

## Problem
The application was showing an error: "BLACKBOX_API_KEY is not configured" even though the key was present in `backend/.env`.

## Root Cause
The diagnostic script revealed that the `.env` file had **quotes around the API key value**:
```env
BLACKBOX_API_KEY="sk-Bqqe-JMxrVsbw3pvSpTytg"  ‚ùå WRONG
```

## Solution
Remove the quotes from the API key value:
```env
BLACKBOX_API_KEY=sk-Bqqe-JMxrVsbw3pvSpTytg  ‚úÖ CORRECT
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced `backend/server.js`
- Added explicit path resolution for the `.env` file using `fileURLToPath` and `dirname`
- Added validation to check if `BLACKBOX_API_KEY` is loaded
- Added helpful console logging to show:
  - ‚úÖ Success message when API key is configured
  - üîë First 10 characters of the API key for verification
  - ‚ùå Error message with troubleshooting tips if not configured

### 2. Created `backend/check-env.js`
- Diagnostic script to verify `.env` file configuration
- Shows file location and existence
- Displays sanitized environment variable values
- Detects common issues like:
  - Quotes around values
  - Spaces in keys or values
  - Missing or empty values

### 3. Created `backend/.env.example`
- Template file showing correct `.env` format
- Includes all necessary environment variables
- Can be copied to create a new `.env` file

### 4. Created `backend/ENV_SETUP.md`
- Comprehensive guide for environment variable setup
- Common mistakes and how to avoid them
- Troubleshooting steps
- Verification instructions

## How to Fix Your Issue

### Step 1: Update Your .env File
Open `backend/.env` and ensure it looks like this (no quotes):
```env
BLACKBOX_API_KEY=sk-Bqqe-JMxrVsbw3pvSpTytg
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=development
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

### Step 2: Verify Configuration
Run the diagnostic script:
```bash
node backend/check-env.js
```

You should see:
```
‚úÖ SUCCESS: BLACKBOX_API_KEY is properly configured!
```

### Step 3: Restart the Server
Stop your current server (Ctrl+C) and start it again:
```bash
npm start
```

Or use the start scripts:
```bash
# Windows
start.bat

# Linux/Mac
./start.sh
```

### Step 4: Verify Server Logs
When the server starts, you should see:
```
‚úÖ BLACKBOX_API_KEY is configured
üîë API Key (first 10 chars): sk-Bqqe-J...
üöÄ Server running on http://localhost:3001
```

## Prevention
- Always use the `.env.example` file as a template
- Never add quotes around environment variable values in `.env` files
- Run `node backend/check-env.js` after making changes to verify
- Check server logs on startup to confirm configuration

## Additional Resources
- See `backend/ENV_SETUP.md` for detailed setup instructions
- See `backend/.env.example` for the correct format template
- Use `backend/check-env.js` anytime to diagnose configuration issues
