The new UI flow maintains 100% compatibility with the existing backend:

```javascript
// Data mapping example
brandGuidelinesText = `${brandGuidelines}\n\nBrand Voice: ${brandVoice}\nColors: ${brandColors}`

campaignPrompt = `Platform: ${platform}\nTarget Audience: ${targetAudience}\n\nProduct: ${productName}\n${productDescription}\n\nCampaign Objective: ${campaignObjective}\nMessage: ${campaignMessage}\n\nAdditional Notes: ${campaignNotes}`
```

The backend still receives the same two main fields plus file uploads, ensuring no breaking changes.
